print("Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and "
      "self-sustaining processes,\n from that which does not, and is defined by the capacity for growth, reaction to "
      "stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation,\n and reproduction. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, "
      "animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria.\n Biology is the science that studies life.")
